## Key Concepts Learned
### Algorith
A set of rules or instructions for solving a problem or completing a task
sssss
- **Algorithmic Decision Making in Government**

Systems used to assist or replace human decision-makers 

**Criminal Justice:** Recidivism risk scores for bail and sentencing decisions <br>
**Housing & Finance:** Mortgage lending and tenant screening algorithms <br>
**Healthcare Patient:** care prioritization and resource allocation

- **Why Government Uses Algorithms**

**Efficiency:** process more cases faster <br>
**Consistency:** same rules applied to everyone <br>
**Objectivity:** removes human bias <br>
**Cost savings:** fewer staff needed <br>

- **When Algorithms Go Wrong**

Every step involves human choices which embed human values and biases

**Data cleaning decisions** <br>
**Data collection:** use of imperfect proxies <br>
**How you interpret results** <br>
**What variables you put in the model** <br>
**Examples:** Healthcare Algorithm Bias/ Criminal Justice Algorithm Bias/ Dutch Welfare Fraud Detection


### Census Data and American Community Survey (ACS)
- **Decennial Census**

**9 basic questions:** age, race, sex, housing <br>
**Everyone** counted every 10 years<br>
Block group level - very local analysis (Pay attention to **big MOEs**)<br>
**Differential Privacy:** Add mathematical “noise” to protect privacy while preserving overall patterns
**Summary Tables** vs **PUMS - Individual Records**

- **American Community Survey (ACS)**

**Detailed questions:** income, education, employment, housing costs <br>
3% of households surveyed **annually** <br>
**1-Year Estimates** vs **5-Year Estimates**

- **Why matters**
Understanding community demographics/ Allocating government resources/ Tracking neighborhood change/ Designing fair algorithms

- **ACS result includes**

`GEOID` - Geographic identifier <br>
`NAME` - Human-readable location name <br>
`variable` - Census variable code <br>
`estimate` - The actual value <br>
`moe` - Margin of error <br>

## Coding Techniques
### tidycensus---R packages to access data directly
Always get latest data/ Reproducible workflows/ Automatic geographic boundaries/ Built-in error handling

### Rules of using data
- Small MOE relative to estimate = **more reliable**
- Always **report MOE** alongside estimates
- Be cautious comparing estimates with **overlapping error margins**
- Consider using 5-year estimates for greater reliability

### Codes
`output = "wide"` - gives you one row per place, multiple columns for variables <br>
`str_remove()`/ `str_extract()`/ `str_replace()` - Clean up messy geographic names <br>
`case_when()` - for categories, MOE calculations(Calculating Data Reliability) <br>
`kable()` - for professional formatting

## Questions & Challenges
- The accurate and best steps of using these data

## Connections to Policy
- Algorithms help a lot in policy decisions

## Reflection
- Finally knew why this course is called “Public Policy Analysis”...
