## Key Concepts Learned
### Why Visualization Matters

- **Anscombe’s Quartet: The Famous Example**

Four datasets with identical summary statistics:5 <br>
Same means (x̄ = 9, ȳ = 7.)5 <br>
Same variances <br>
Same correlation (r = 0.816) <br>
Same regression line <br>
**But completely different patterns when visualized**

- **The Policy Implications**

-Summary statistics can hide critical patterns <br>
-Outliers may represent important communities <br>
-Relationships aren’t always linear <br>
-Visual inspection reveals data quality issues <br>

- **Bad Visualizations Have Real Consequences**

Common problems in government data presentation: <br>
-Misleading scales or axes <br>
-Cherry-picked time periods <br>
-Hidden or ignored uncertainty <br>
-Missing context about data reliability <br>
**Real impact:** 72% of Portland census tracts had unreliable child poverty estimates, yet planners rarely communicated this uncertainty. <br>
**Result:** Poor policy decisions based on misunderstood data

### Grammar of Graphics
- **The ggplot2 Philosophy**

Grammar of Graphics principles: <br>
**Data:** Your dataset (census data, survey responses, etc.) <br>
**Aesthetics:** What variables map to visual properties (x, y, color, size) <br>
**Geometries:** How to display the data (points, bars, lines) <br>
**Additional layers:** Scales, themes, facets, annotations <br>

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- **The EDA Mindset**

Exploratory Data Analysis is detective work: <br>
-What does the data look like? (distributions, missing values) <br>
-What patterns exist? (relationships, clusters, trends) <br>
-What’s unusual? (outliers, anomalies, data quality issues) <br>
-What questions does this raise? (hypotheses for further investigation) <br>
-How reliable is this data?

**Goal:** Understand your data before making decisions or building models

- **EDA Workflow with Data Quality Focus**

Enhanced process for policy analysis: <br>
**Load and inspect** - dimensions, variable types, missing data <br>
**Assess reliability** - examine margins of error, calculate coefficients of variation <br>
**Visualize distributions** - histograms, boxplots for each variable <br>
**Explore relationships** - scatter plots, correlations <br>
**Identify patterns** - grouping, clustering, geographical patterns <br>
**Question anomalies** - investigate outliers and unusual patterns <br>
**Document limitations** - prepare honest communication about data quality <br>

- **Understanding Distributions**

**What to look for:** Skewness, outliers, multiple peaks, gaps

- **Critical: Data Quality Through Visualization**

**Research insight:** Most planners don’t visualize or communicate uncertainty <br>
**Pattern:** Smaller populations have higher uncertainty Ethical implication: These communities might be systematically undercounted <br> 
**Block** - **Block Group(ACS)** - **Census Tracts(Census)**, MOE gets smaller

- **Research-Based Recommendations for Planners**

5 Essential Guidelines for Using ACS Data(Jurjevich et al. 2018) <br>
**1. Report the corresponding MOEs of ACS estimates** - Always include margin of error values <br>
**2.Include a footnote when not reporting MOEs** - Explicitly acknowledge omission <br>
**3.Provide context for (un)reliability** - Use coefficient of variation (CV): <br>
  - CV < 12% = reliable (green coding) <br>
  - CV 12-40% = somewhat reliable (yellow) <br>
  - CV > 40% = unreliable (red coding) <br>
**4.Reduce statistical uncertainty** - Collapse data detail, aggregate geographies, use multi-year estimates <br>
**5.Always conduct statistical significance tests** when comparing ACS estimates over time <br>

**Key insight:** These practices are not just technical best practices—they are ethical requirements under the AICP Code of Ethics

- **EDA for Policy Analysis**

Key questions for census data: <br>
**Geographic patterns:** Are problems concentrated in certain areas? <br>
**Population relationships:** How does size affect data quality? <br>
**Demographic patterns:** Are certain communities systematically different? <br>
**Temporal trends:** How do patterns change over time? <br>
**Data integrity:** Where might survey bias affect results? <br>
**Reliability assessment:** Which estimates should we trust? <br>

### Data Joins & Integration

- **Why Join Data?**
-Census demographics + Economic indicators <br>
-Survey responses + Geographic boundaries <br>
-Current data + Historical trends <br>
-Administrative records + Survey data <br>

- **Types of Joins (tabular)**

Four main types in dplyr: <br>
`left_join()` - Keep all rows from left dataset <br>
`right_join()` - Keep all rows from right dataset <br>
`inner_join()` - Keep only rows that match in both <br>
`full_join()` - Keep all rows from both datasets <br>

**Most common:** left_join() to add columns to your main dataset

## Coding Techniques
### Basic ggplot2 Structure
Every ggplot has this pattern:
`ggplot(data = your_data) +   aes(x = variable1, y = variable2) +   geom_something() +   additional_layers()`

`+`to add layers


## Questions & Challenges
- ggplot grammar
- How to read a boxplot

## Connections to Policy
- Data visualization directly affects the understanding of the public and decision-makers <br>
- Box plots or scatter plots can reveal extreme values, which often represent the conditions of vulnerable groups and may require special attention in policy <br>

## Reflection
- In policy analysis, I need to constantly ponder: Will my charts be misleading? Does it fully reflect the limitations of the data?
