The department is considering implementing an algorithmic\nsystem to identify communities that should receive priority for social\nservice funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to\nevaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform\nthis decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess\nnot just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what\ncommunities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n-   Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n-   Evaluate data quality using margins of error\n-   Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n-   Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n-   Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your\nassignment should be accessible at\n`your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this\nassignment under an \"Assignments\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an\n`assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure.

Consider: Which counties might be poorly served by\nalgorithms that rely on this income data? What factors might contribute\nto higher uncertainty?*\n\nThese results suggest that counties with **small populations** or\n**rural economies** are more likely to have high margins of error in\ntheir income estimates, meaning algorithms relying on this data may\nperform poorly there. In contrast, large metropolitan counties tend to\nhave more reliable estimates due to **larger sample sizes**. Therefore,\n**low population density**, **high economic variability**, and **limited\nsurvey** responses contribute to higher uncertainty in rural areas.\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for\ndetailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability\nlevels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to\ncompare how data quality varies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\nselected_counties <- ca_data_reliability %>%\n  filter(\n    income_reliability %in% c(\"High Confidence\", \n                              \"Moderate Confidence\", \n                              \"Low Confidence\")\n  ) %>%\n  group_by(income_reliability) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n  select(\n    GEOID = GEOID,\n    County = NAME,\n    Median_Income = median_incomeE,\n    MOE_Percent = income_moe_pct,\n    Reliability = income_reliability,\n    Population = total_popE\n  )\n\n\nkable(selected_counties, digits = 2, caption = \"3 selected counties\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: 3 selected counties\n\n|GEOID |County  | Median_Income| MOE_Percent|Reliability         | Population|\n|:-----|:-------|-------------:|-----------:|:-------------------|----------:|\n|06001 |Alameda |        122488|        1.00|High Confidence     |    1663823|\n|06003 |Alpine  |        101125|       17.25|Low Confidence      |       1515|\n|06005 |Amador  |         74853|        8.08|Moderate Confidence |      40577|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n <br>\n <br>\n**Comment on the output:**\n\n**Alameda County** shows a high confidence estimate, with a margin of\nerror of only about 1%. This indicates that the income data here is very\nreliable, likely due to the county’s **large population** and\n**extensive survey responses**. <br> **Alpine County** represents low\nconfidence, with an MOE exceeding 17%. This high level of uncertainty is\ntypical of **small rural counties**, where limited survey responses make\nACS estimates less reliable.

Do certain types of communities have less reliable data? What might explain this?*\n\nAlthough we might expect tracts with smaller populations to have higher MOE, the results show that average and median population sizes are quite **similar** between the two groups. This indicates that population size alone does not determine data reliability. Instead, the **distribution of racial and ethnic groups** plays a key role.\n\nIn the high-MOE group, tracts have a **higher share of White residents** but **a much lower share of Black residents**. This suggests that in these tracts the Black population is very small, so the estimates for this group are highly uncertain, pushing the tract into the high-MOE category. Conversely, **tracts with a larger share of Black residents** may have relatively stable estimates even if their overall populations are modest.\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:** \n\n***1. Overall Pattern Identification:*** *What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?* <br>\n***2. Equity Assessment:*** *Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?* <br>\n***3. Root Cause Analysis:*** *What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?* <br>\n***4. Strategic Recommendations:*** *What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?* <br>\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n**1. Overall Pattern Identification**\n\n- Rural/small-sample tracts and some urban tracts with highly uneven group distributions both exhibit elevated MOE.\n- Using 15% flags almost everything; 30–50% produces separation but still shows wide dispersion—so conclusions depend on the cutoff.\n- In this case, igh MOE at the tract level is driven less by total population and more by tiny counts for specific groups (e.g., Black or Hispanic residents), even inside populous urban tracts.\n\n**2. Equity Assessment**\n\n- Communities with small subgroup counts (e.g., tracts where Black or Hispanic residents are a small share) face the highest risk that algorithms misread local conditions.\n- In this study, the communities facing the greatest risk of algorithmic bias are tracts with very small Black populations. Even in populous Alameda County, tracts where Black residents make up only a small share had MOE% well above 30–50%, meaning algorithms could mischaracterize their socioeconomic conditions.\n\n**3. Root Cause Analysis**\n\n- ACS tract samples are thin; when subgroup E is small, M/E explodes.\n- I used fixed cutoffs (15%, 30%, 50%) to classify “high MOE,” but these thresholds are arbitrary. Depending on the cutoff, many or almost all tracts fall into the “high MOE” category, which affects how we interpret which communities face higher risk.\n\n**4. Strategic Recommendations**\n\n- Penalize high-MOE inputs, widen decision margins, or route to human review when reliability is low.\n- Always report county/tract-level averages with weights, so small tracts don’t distort conclusions. This reduces misleading patterns like “all tracts are high MOE.”\n- When showing median income or race/ethnicity percentages, present both the estimate and its MOE (or reliability flag). That way, decision-makers won’t treat noisy values as precise.\n- For tracts with extremely high MOE, aggregate them into larger areas (e.g., county or multi-tract regions) before using them in algorithms.\n- Before deploying an algorithm that uses ACS variables, test whether outputs for small minority populations (e.g., Black residents in Alameda tracts, Hispanic residents in Alpine/Amador) are disproportionately driven by high-MOE inputs.\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\nrecommendations_data <- ca_data_reliability %>%\n  select(\n    County = NAME,\n    Median_Income = median_incomeE,\n    MOE_Percent = income_moe_pct,\n    Reliability = income_reliability\n  ) %>%\n  \n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# - High Confidence: \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\"\n# - Moderate Confidence: \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\"  \n# - Low Confidence: \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n  mutate(\n    Recommendation = case_when(\n      Reliability == \"High Confidence\" ~ \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\",\n      Reliability == \"Moderate Confidence\" ~ \"Use with caution – monitor outcomes\",\n      Reliability == \"Low Confidence\" ~ \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n    )\n  )\n\n# Format as a professional table with kable()\nkable(head(recommendations_data,10), digits = 1,\n      caption = \"Decision Framework for Algorithm Implementation\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Decision Framework for Algorithm Implementation\n\n|County       | Median_Income| MOE_Percent|Reliability         |Recommendation                            |\n|:------------|-------------:|-----------:|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------|\n|Alameda      |        122488|         1.0|High Confidence     |Safe for algorithmic decisions            |\n|Alpine       |        101125|        17.2|Low Confidence      |Requires manual review or additional data |\n|Amador       |         74853|         8.1|Moderate Confidence |Use with caution – monitor outcomes       |\n|Butte        |         66085|         3.4|High Confidence     |Safe for algorithmic decisions            |\n|Calaveras    |         77526|         5.0|High Confidence     |Safe for algorithmic decisions            |\n|Colusa       |         69619|         8.3|Moderate Confidence |Use with caution – monitor outcomes       |\n|Contra Costa |        120020|         1.2|High Confidence     |Safe for algorithmic decisions            |\n|Del Norte    |         61149|         7.2|Moderate Confidence |Use with caution – monitor outcomes       |\n|El Dorado    |         99246|         3.4|High Confidence     |Safe for algorithmic decisions            |\n|Fresno       |         67756|         1.4|High Confidence     |Safe for algorithmic decisions            |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to\nthe department.\n\n **1.

Other researchers making different selections (e.g., largest population, random choice) could obtain different tract-level patterns. <br>\n- **2.Threshold definitions:** I defined “high MOE” using cutoffs at 50%. The threshold is arbitrary; using different thresholds would change which tracts fall into high/low confidence groups.\n\n**Limitations:** \n\n*Note any limitations in your analysis - sample size\nissues, geographic scope, temporal factors, etc.*\n\n- **Sample size:** Tract-level ACS estimates rely on small samples; margins of error are especially large for minority populations in low-density areas. <br>\n- **Temporal scope:** Analyses used the 2018–2022 ACS 5-year estimates. Patterns could change in other time windows or under decennial census data. <br>\n- **Geographic scope:** Only three counties (Alameda, Amador, Alpine) were examined. These choices illustrate reliability categories but may not generalize to all of California. <br>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n-   [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n-   [ ] All \"\\[Fill this in\\]\" prompts have been completed\n-   [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n-   [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n-   [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n-   [ ] Census API key is properly set\n-   [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.\nYour assignment should be accessible at\n`your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/your_file_name.html`\n",
